/*! \brief Provides the primitivve event-detection and processing
 routines for all events.

 This class provides the fundamental operations of classes like
 Interaction, Global, Local and System. For example, in the
 IHardSphere Interaction, we need to detect when two spheres will
 intersect and this is done using the \ref SphereSphereInRoot of the
 Dynamics class.

 These functions are stored in the Dynamics class for two
 reasons. First, it cuts down on the duplication of code between all
 of these event classes. Secondly, we can change the Dynamics to
 include gravity (\ref DynGravity) or multicanonical potentials
 (\ref DynNewtonianMC) without having to alter all of the event
 classes.

 The bulk of the functions are actually implemented in the
 DynNewtonian class.

 Before using any functions in this class you must updateParticle
 first with the exception of the getSquareCell events! This is to
 make sure the Delayed States algorithm is up to date for the
 particles being tested.
