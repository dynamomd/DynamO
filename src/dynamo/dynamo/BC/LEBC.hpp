    This stream velocity is based off a linear interpolation between

    the simulation boundaries and its periodic images.

    This is an important distinction to make, as Lees-Edwards
    boundary conditions do not force a linear shear profile, only a
    specified fixed shear rate over a box length. To enforce a linear
    profile you must also use a thermostat, but this may be
    problematic (see Evans and Morris, "Statistical Mechanics of
    Nonequilibrium Liquids"). Essentially, a thermostat will cause
    "strings" to form in the system.
