/*! \brief A Global event which helps prevent wrap around problems
 * with neighbor lists in periodic systems.
 *
 * If a particle has a clear path from one end of the simulation to
 * the other and PBC are applied, the cellular neighbor lists can
 * enter an infinite loop. The particle keeps travelling around and
 * around the simulation, without actually moving forward in time
 * because it doesn't actually hit anything.
 *
 * This Global attempts to break this infinite loop by making
 * particles have a virtual event when they travel half a simulation
 * box length.
