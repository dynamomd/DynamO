/*! \brief A class to create a sparse array which is addressed
  using floating point values.

  Standard arrays/vectors are addressed using a unsigned integer
  type, specifying the offset into the data. However, there are
  times where it would be easier to address an array using a
  floating point type (the prime example is in
  histogramming). This class solves this problem by storing a bin
  width (actually the inverse bin width \ref _invBinWidth), which
  is used to map a floating point value to a bin.

  This class is space efficient as it uses a map to store the
  allocated bins. A map (not a unordered_map) must be the
  default, as histogramming output assumes the values are sorted.

  Both the bin width and the inverse bin width are stored within
  the class. The inverse is stored as multiply operations are far
  cheaper than divides, so this accelerates the array access
  operator. The bin width is stored to ensure the following code
  is true
  \code
  FuzzyArray<T>(some_bin_width).getBinWidth() == some_bin_width
  \endcode

  There may be a loss of precision when converting the inverse bin
  width back to the bin width which would cause the above
  comparison to fail. As such, the original bin width is stored.

  \tparam T The type stored by the FuzzyArray.
  \tparam shiftBin If false, bins are centered about whole integers, if true
  bins are centered between whole integers.
  \tparam Container The underlying container used in the FuzzyArray.
