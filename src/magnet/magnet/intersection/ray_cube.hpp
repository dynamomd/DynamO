/*! \brief A ray->Axis-Aligned-Cube intersection test with back
  face culling.

  This test works by determining when the ray entered the axis
  aligned "range" of each cubes face. Then it is tested if the
  entries are all before the exits, if true the ray intersects the
  cube at some point. Finally, we check if the intersecting ray is
  approaching the cube at the entry point in order to cull back
  faces.

  \param T The origin of the ray relative to the cube center.
  \param D The direction/velocity of the ray.
  \param C The dimensions of the cube.
  \return The time until the intersection, or HUGE_VAL if no intersection.
