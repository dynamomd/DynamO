  The method used here is described in "An Efficient
  Ray-Quadrilateral Intersection Test", by Ares Lagae and Philip
  Dutr√©.

  \tparam BACKFACE_CULLING Ignores ray plane intersections
  where the ray enters the back of the plane.
  \param T The origin of the ray relative to a point on the plane.
  \param D The direction/velocity of the ray.
  \param N The normal of the plane.
  \param E1 An edge of the quadrangle (V1 - V0);
  \param E2 Another edge of the quadrangle (V2 - V0);
  \return The time until the intersection, or HUGE_VAL if no intersection.
