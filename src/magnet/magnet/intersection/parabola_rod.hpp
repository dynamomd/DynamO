/*! \brief A parabola-rod intersection test.

  A rod is a cylinder which is not infinite, but of limited
  length. The cylinder is defined using a single base vertex at the
  center of the bottom circular face and an axial vector pointing
  from the base vertex to the top vertex. This test ignores the
  back face of the rod. It is used to detect when a parabolic ray
  will enter a rod.

  \param T The origin of the ray relative to the base vertex.
  \param D The direction/velocity of the ray.
  \param Aray The acceleration acting on the ray.
  \param A The axial vector of the rod.
  \param r Radius of the rod.
  \return The time until the intersection, or HUGE_VAL if no intersection.
