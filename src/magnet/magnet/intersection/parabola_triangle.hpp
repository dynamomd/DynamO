/*! \brief A parabola-triangle intersection test.

  Here we make the assumption that all positions are relative to
  the first vertex. Thus we only need to pass the two edge vectors
  of the triangle.

  \param T The origin of the ray relative to the first vertex.
  \param D The direction/velocity of the ray.
  \param A The acceleration of the ray.
  \param E1 The first edge vector of the triangle (V1-V0).
  \param E2 The second edge vector of the triangle (V2-V0).
  \return The time until the intersection, or HUGE_VAL if no intersection.
