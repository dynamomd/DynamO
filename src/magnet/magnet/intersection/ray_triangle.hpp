/*! \brief A ray-triangle intersection test.

 The method used is described in "Fast, minimum storage
 ray-triangle intersection", by Tomas MÃ¶ller and Ben Trumbore.

 Here we make the assumption that all positions are relative to
 the first vertex. Thus we only need to pass the two edge
 vectors of the triangle.

 For backface culling, we use counter-clockwise ordering of the
 vertices.

 \tparam BACKFACE_CULLING Ignores ray triangle intersections
 where the ray enters the back face of the triangle.
 \tparam DIAGONAL_TEST Enables one of the checks used to make
 sure the intersection point is within the triangle. This
 should only be turned off to implement other ray-shape
 intersection tests (\sa ray_quadrilateral).

 \param T The origin of the ray relative to the first vertex.
 \param D The direction/velocity of the ray.
 \param E1 The first edge vector of the triangle (V1-V0).
 \param E2 The second edge vector of the triangle (V2-V0).
 \return The time until the intersection, or HUGE_VAL if no intersection.
