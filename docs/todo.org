*** DynamO Future
**** DONE DynamO: Removal of the Dynamics and SimData classes
***** DONE DynamO: Remove the Dynamics class and move its functions into the SimData class.
***** DONE DynamO: Rename the Liouvillean Class to Dynamics.
***** DONE DynamO: Combine the SimData and Simulation classes.
**** DONE DynamO: Make a special MAX value for the Neighbourhood range.
**** DONE DynamO: Revisit all of the old output plugins.
***** DONE DynamO: Add a average and current system momentum to the misc output plugin (replace the mutual diffusion correlators calculation of it, and anyone elses).
***** DONE DynamO: Either remove correlators from DynamO, or fix them so that short correlators don't output NaN's!
***** DONE DynamO: Make the output plugins much simpler.
***** DONE DynamO: Put all of the cheap/free simulation data calculations into the misc output plugin, so that they don't have to be loaded and people have an interesting default output.xml.bz2.
***** DONE DynamO: Remove the KEnergy and UEnergy plugins, convert dynahistrw and other scripts to this new format.
**** DONE Coil: Make coil scale independent.
**** DONE Coil: Fixed segfaults on Ubuntu systems.
**** DONE Magnet: Change strerror to wrap strerror_r
**** TODO DynamO: Move to pugixml, and add the github submodule.
**** TODO DynamO: Get rid of globals and locals, move to 1 particle and 2 particle events.
**** TODO DynamO: Make an inelasticity of 0 work. 
**** TODO DynamO: The oscillating plate interaction is a mess, and uses RECALCULATE events, when it should not.
**** TODO DynamO: Replica exchange cleanup
***** TODO DynamO: Allow replica exchanges in collisions.
***** TODO DynamO: Remove the unusual replica exchange modes and simplify to just one. Also put the up and down swap ratios in the data.

**** DONE DynamO: Make compression work with polydisperse walls.
**** DONE DynamO: Currently, if we have square well chains, all of the linked monomers also appear in the capture map! This will artificially increase the energy of the base configuration, we need to check that the capture interaction is the valid interaction for the pair tested.

***** TODO Optimize triangle meshes (a new neighbour list?).
***** TODO Make test cases for the triangle.
***** TODO Add diameters to the triangles.
**** TODO DynamO: Make a test for an invalid state in locals, globals and interactions (for particle insertion).
**** TODO DynamO: Auto detect the ensemble, users shouldn't have to specify it.

***** TODO Coil: Make a GL engine to put into magnet.
***** TODO Coil: Look at CL/GL synchronisation objects for coil.
*** DynamO 1.3							    :ARCHIVE:
**** DONE DynamO: The file format has been changed to get rid of the dynamics tag, and rename the Liouvillean tag to Dynamics instead (you will need to regenerate your config files).
**** DONE DynamO: 2D systems are now officially supported/maintained in DynamO.
**** DONE DynamO/Coil: Visualisation no longer requires an OpenCL compatible graphics card! However, you do still need an OpenCL library installed.
**** DONE DynamO: Removed the requirement of a statically linked bzip2 or zlib library.
**** DONE Bugfix DynamO: Found the neighbourlists were not being correctly reinitialised, causing slowdowns and possible hangs in compressing systems (huge speed boost in compression).
**** DONE Bugfix DynamO: Multi-core parallel tempering is now actually in parallel. Until now the code actually has been executing in serial.
**** DONE Bugfix DynamO: Fixed a rare bug in compressing systems, where neighbourlists would be incorrectly sized after a compression.
**** DONE Coil: Added a fullscreen mode, toggled with the f key.
**** DONE Coil: Objects can now be dragged, for example, the lights can be repositioned using the mouse.
**** DONE DynamO: Packing of systems into systems is now easy to perform.
**** DONE DynamO: An estimate of the remaining time left for the simulation is now outputted on the screen.
**** DONE DynamO: Up to 50% faster in polydisperse systems thanks to a new cache friendly nblist implementation.
**** DONE DynamO: SLLOD dynamics have been removed, they are unmaintained and unused. Shearing systems are still available through Lees-Edwards boundary conditions, just not in transformed co-ordinates.
**** DONE DynamO: All particle positions are now shuffled for mixture systems in dynamod to enable faster equilibration.
**** DONE DynamO: Removed all deprecated Clone functions for copying of classes in the code.
**** DONE DynamO: Alter the functions in dynamics that add/get/set objects and take/return a pointer to return shared_ptr's (search for uses of shared_ptr's get() function).
**** DONE DynamO: Removed the const casting in the liouvillean, and interactions to make dynamo const correct.
**** DONE DynamO: Change the loadClass XML functions to return shared_ptr's.
**** DONE DynamO: Improved the sizing of systems when dropping random polymers (dynamod -m2).
**** DONE Bugfix DynamO: Changed the default settings of the histogram reweighting program so that the results are accurate by default! Previously, the results coming out of dynahist_rw could be quite innaccurate unless --min-err=1e-16 was set.
**** DONE Bugfix DynamO: The uniform_01 distribution had its own copy of the random number generator. It is unlikely that this affected any results, but it is not good practice.
**** DONE Bugfix DynamO: The Green-Kubo Mutual diffusion correlator now works (instead of just outputting NaN/inf).
**** DONE DynamO/Coil: Remove the requirement to pass the frequency to the visualizer, it guesses at one MFT for each particle.
**** DONE Coil: Moved to a combined deferred/forward rendering pipline which greatly improves rendering performance and flexibility.
**** DONE Coil: Added High-Dynamic-Range (HDR) lighting and gamma correction.
**** DONE Coil: With HDR, Bloom effects can now be enabled to simulate over-exposure.
**** DONE Coil: Sphere glyphs used to render particles are ray-traced! This allows the rendering of millions of perfectly spherical particles.
**** DONE Coil: Cleaned up the stereo (3D) vision mode, so it's possible for 3D TV's to use it as well as red-cyan glasses.
**** DONE Coil: There is now a separate Volume rendering visualisation executable to allow direct visualisation of volume data.
**** DONE Coil: Volume rendering now uses pre-integrated transfer functions for greatly improved render quality.
**** DONE Coil: Added new camera controls for positioning and aligning the camera along with a new camera control modes.
**** DONE Coil: Now requires and complies with the OpenGL 3.3 Core profile.
**** DONE Coil: Fixed segfaults occurring when adding a window crashes the main render thread.
**** DONE Coil: Fixed a rare segfault caused by a miscalculation of the glade file data size stored in memory.
**** DONE Coil: The snapshot button now captures using the same file counter as the record button.
**** DONE Coil: Added some sharpen and hi-pass filters to the screen space effects.
**** DONE Coil: Now it is easy to use multiple light sources in the render scene.
**** DONE Bugfix Coil: Fix light placement relative to camera.
**** DONE Bugfix Coil: Fixed the bilateral blur filter.
**** DONE Bugfix Coil: Fixed many bugs which only appear when resizing the display.
**** DONE Magnet: Upgraded all shaders to GLSL 330.

**** DONE Coil: Sped up PNG output in coil by 33 percent.
**** DONE Magnet: XML errors are now much more verbose and tell you exactly what went wrong and where.
*** DynamO 1.1 							    :ARCHIVE:
**** DONE *MAJOR* Remove Unit types from the XML file and simulator.
**** DONE *MAJOR* Remove aspect ratio and instead load the primary image cell size.
