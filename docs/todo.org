*** DynamO 1.3
**** DONE DynamO: 2D systems are now officially *supported* in DynamO, although they're not optimal.
**** DONE DynamO/Coil: Visualisation no longer requires an OpenCL compatible graphics card! However, you do still need an OpenCL library installed.
**** DONE DynamO: Up to 50% faster in polydisperse systems thanks to a new cache friendly nblist implementation.
**** DONE DynamO: SLLOD dynamics have been removed, they are unmaintained and unused. Shearing is still available, just not in transformed co-ordinates.
**** DONE DynamO: All particle positions are now shuffled for mixture systems in dynamod to enable faster equilibration.
**** DONE DynamO: Removed all deprecated Clone functions for copying of classes in the code.
**** DONE DynamO: Alter the functions in dynamics that add/get/set objects and take/return a pointer to return shared_ptr's (search for uses of shared_ptr's get() function).
**** DONE DynamO: Change the loadClass XML functions to return shared_ptr's.
**** DONE Bugfix DynamO: Changed the default settings of the histogram reweighting program so that the results are accurate by default! Previously, the results coming out of dynahist_rw could be quite innaccurate unless --min-err=1e-16 was set.
**** DONE DynamO/Coil: Remove the requirement to pass the frequency to the visualiser, it guesses at one MFT for each particle.
**** DONE Coil: Moved to a combined deferred/forward rendering pipline which greatly improves rendering performance and flexibility.
**** DONE Coil: Added High-Dynamic-Range (HDR) lighting and gamma correction.
**** DONE Coil: With HDR, Bloom effects can now be enabled to simulate over-exposure.
**** DONE Coil: Sphere glyphs used to render particles are ray-traced! This allows the rendering of millions of perfectly spherical particles.
**** DONE Coil: Cleaned up the stereo (3D) vision mode, so it's possible for 3D TV's to use it as well as red-cyan glasses.
**** DONE Coil: There is now a separate Volume rendering visualisation executable to allow direct visualisation of volume data.
**** DONE Coil: Volume rendering now uses pre-integrated transfer functions for greatly improved render quality.
**** DONE Coil: Added new camera controls for positioning and aligning the camera along with a new camera control modes.
**** DONE Coil: Now requires and complies with the OpenGL 3.3 Core profile.
**** DONE Coil: Fixed segfaults occurring when adding a window crashes the main render thread.
**** DONE Coil: Fixed a rare segfault caused by a miscalculation of the glade file data size stored in memory.
**** DONE Coil: The snapshot button now captures using the same file counter as the record button.
**** DONE Coil: Added some sharpen and hi-pass filters to the screen space effects.
**** DONE Coil: Now it is easy to use multiple light sources in the render scene.
**** DONE Bugfix Coil: Corrected the shadow mapping calculation and removed the noise.
**** DONE Bugfix Coil: Fix light placement relative to camera.
**** DONE Bugfix Coil: Fixed the bilateral blur filter.
**** DONE Bugfix Coil: Fixed the rendering on NVIDIA drivers.
**** DONE Magnet: Upgraded all shaders to GLSL 330.
**** TODO Coil: Fix resizing the display on AMD hardware.
**** TODO Coil: Fix the Bilateral blur filter, or at least make it work well with SSAO
**** TODO Coil: Fix the incorrect calculation of the camera position, due to the head position not being added on. This is breaking lots of calculations (e.g. SSAO at close range, possibly the volume rendering flicker).
**** TODO DynamO: Confirm that the tutorials are up to date on the removal of the -h tag.
**** TODO DynamO: Add the gravity version of the sphere-sphere-out test. Fix and check that the umbrella implementation is general.
**** TODO DynamO: Make compression work with polydisperse walls.
**** TODO DynamO: Fix the incorrect GitHash being set in the executable.

**** DONE *BUGFIX* Fixed the widespread improper use of the XML test functions, causing errors instead of warnings.

**** DONE All: You can now install the magnet and coil library into your system for use in other projects.
**** DONE DynamO: The ParabolaSentinel global is now added automatically to simulations, it needs to be deleted from existing configurations.
